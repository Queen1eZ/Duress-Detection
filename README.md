# Duress Detection System

The Duress Detection System aims to develop a robust system capable of identifying stress, tension, and anxiety in speech, with applications in emergency call centers, customer service, and security monitoring. 

## Features
* Detects duress cues in audio recordings.
* Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model.
* Includes a Jupyter Notebook script for making predictions on new audio files.
